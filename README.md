## üõ†Ô∏è What I Did

This project was implemented as part of my learning journey with Spring Security. I followed the tutorial closely and:

- Recreated the project from scratch in my local environment.
- Set up an OAuth2 Authorization Server using Spring Security 6 and the Spring Authorization Server project.
- Compared to the previous lesson, this addresses concepts such as:
    - Added extra information to JWT token
    - Custom validator for redirect uri
    - Using of an opaque token instead of a non-opaque token
    - Get client information by the introspection endpoint
