## üõ†Ô∏è What I Did

This project was implemented as part of my learning journey with Spring Security. I followed the tutorial closely and:

- Recreated the project from scratch in my local environment.
- Set up an OAuth2 Authorization Server using Spring Security 6.
- This lesson involves moving from in-memory users and clients to using ones whose information is saved in the database.
- In achieving this, the following concepts were implemented:
    - JPA Hibernate to create tables according to User and Client entities;
    - Spring Data JPA repositories to provide CRUD operations and custom queries;
    - An implementation of RegisteredClientRepository, CustomClientService, to manage OAuth2 clients, including saving
      and retrieving registered client details;
    - An implementation of UserDetailsService, CustomUserDetailsService, o load application users from the database for
      authentication.
